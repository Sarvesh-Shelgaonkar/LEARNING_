1️⃣ (10 min) Do a gap analysis:
Copy the job description from the advert and paste into a google doc. Form there highlights the bullet points you have (blue) vs don’t have (red) from the job description. Under each one of the ones you have, add examples when you showed those skills (ex: managed an event). For the ones you don’t have, add anything that could complement that skill.

2️⃣ (10 min) Research the company:
Don’t just skim the website - dig deeper. Use ChatGPT or Perplexity with a prompt like: “I’m interviewing for [Company] for a [Role]. Tell me everything I need to know for the interview. What are the top priorities and challenges for [Company] in 2025?” Look for product launches, leadership updates, recent news, and how they make money. Show you understand their world.

3️⃣(10 min) Find the likely questions:
Head to Glassdoor and look for real interview questions from that company. Then put together in a doc the 10 most common behavioral questions to start preparing for them (like: Tell me about a time you failed). Pro tip: Don’t memorize - just prepare one story you can flex across a few questions.

4️⃣ (20 min) Practice your answers:
For behavioral interview questions use STARL: Situation, Task, Action, Result - and what you Learned. To prepare, use tools like Google Interview Warmup or ChatGPT to test your answers. Prompt idea:
“Give me feedback on this answer using the STARL method. Here’s the question and here’s my answer…”

5️⃣ (10 min) Prep 3–5 smart questions to ask them:
Asking food questions is key. Aim for: 2 role-specific (show you understand the day-to-day). 2 company-specific (prove you did your research). This is your chance to show you’re not just job hunting - you’re intentional.
