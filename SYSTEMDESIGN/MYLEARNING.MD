## 🧠 1. What is System Design?

**System Design** is the process of **designing the architecture of a software system** by defining its **components, interactions, data flow, and scalability strategy**.

It answers:

* How will the system work?
* How do components communicate?
* How do we handle scale, reliability, performance, and cost?

---

### 🔧 System Design = Architecture + Infrastructure + Flow

Example:
📱 *Designing Instagram*

* What components do you need? (User service, post service, feed service, media storage)
* How to scale for 1 billion users?
* How to handle image uploads and feed updates efficiently?

---

## 🎯 2. Why System Design?

Without system design:

* Apps **crash under load** (no scalability)
* **Downtime** increases (no redundancy/failover)
* **Poor performance** (no caching/load balancing)
* **Inflexible systems** (tightly coupled code)

With system design:

* Handles **millions of users**
* Supports **real-time messaging**, **video streaming**, etc.
* Ensures **reliability, speed, maintainability**

> It’s the key difference between building a **toy project** and building a **real-world application**.

 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## 🕰️ 1. **History of Programming Languages**

### 🔹 a. **Machine Language (1st Generation)**

* Uses only **binary (0s and 1s)**
* Specific to a CPU architecture (non-portable)
* Direct hardware-level instructions

**Problems:**

* Prone to error
* Hard to debug
* Not scalable
* Tedious to write long programs

**Example:**

```
10110000 01100001  →  Move 97 into AL register (x86)
```

---

### 🔹 b. **Assembly Language (2nd Generation)**

* Uses mnemonics (like `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`)
* One-to-one mapping with machine instructions
* Slightly more readable

**Problems:**

* Still low-level and architecture-specific
* Prone to human error
* Difficult to manage large programs

**Example:**

```asm
MOV AL, 61h
```

---

### 🔹 c. **Procedural Programming (3rd Generation)**

* Introduced **functions**, **loops**, **blocks**, **control structures**
* Linear execution of instructions
* Code reuse through **functions**

**Popular Languages**: C, Pascal, Fortran

**Limitation**:

* Not suitable for large-scale enterprise systems
* Functions and data are separated
* Hard to model real-world entities with shared behaviors and ownership

**Example** (C):

```c
int speed = 0;
void accelerate() { speed += 10; }
```

---

## 🚘 2. **Why Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

Procedural programming fails when:

* Many entities interact (e.g., Owner owns Car)
* Code becomes hard to **maintain and extend**
* Lack of **modularity, reusability**, and **data hiding**

OOP helps model **real-world entities as objects**, making the system:

* **Scalable**
* **Modular**
* **Reusable**
* **Secure**

---

## 🎯 3. **Real-World Object Modeling in OOP**

### 🔸 **Object**:

Anything that has:

* **Characteristics (Data/Properties)** → `engine`, `model`, `brand`
* **Behaviors (Functions/Methods)** → `start()`, `stop()`, `brake()`

### 🔸 **Class**:

Blueprint of an object.

**Example:**

```cpp
class Car {
  private:
    string model;
    int speed;

  public:
    void start() { ... }
    void stop() { ... }
};
```

---

### ⚠️ Problem in Procedural Model:

Suppose:

* `Owner` owns a `Car`
* Both are real-world objects

In procedural style:

* You use **variables** for car properties
* You use **functions** separately for both entities
* Managing these relationships gets very complex

➡️ That’s where **OOP shines** — it allows objects (like `Owner`, `Car`) to interact naturally.

---

## 🏛️ 4. **Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

### 🧩 a. **Abstraction**

* Showing **only essential details**, hiding complexity
* Focus on **what the object does**, not how it does it

**Real-world Example**:
A driver just needs to know how to **start()**, **accelerate()**, **brake()** — not how the engine works.

**Code:**

```java
car.start();   // We don’t know internal combustion logic, just the interface
```

---

### 🧱 b. **Encapsulation**

* Bundling **data and behavior** in a **single unit** (class)
* Using **access modifiers** to protect data

**Access Modifiers**:

| Modifier    | Accessible Within | Inherited Classes | Outside Class |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| `public`    | ✅                 | ✅                 | ✅             |
| `protected` | ✅                 | ✅                 | ❌             |
| `private`   | ✅                 | ❌                 | ❌             |

**Security Example:**

```cpp
class BankAccount {
  private:
    int balance;

  public:
    void deposit(int amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }
    int getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

➡️ Even though balance is private, it can be accessed through controlled methods (getters/setters).

---

### 👪 c. **Inheritance**

* One class inherits from another
* Promotes **code reuse** and **hierarchical relationships**

**Real-world Example**:

```txt
Vehicle (Parent)
 ├── ManualCar (Child)
 └── ElectricCar (Child)
```

Both cars share `brand`, `start()`, but have specific behaviors too.

**Code:**

```java
class Car {
  void start() { ... }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car {
  void chargeBattery() { ... }
}
```

---

### 🌀 d. **Polymorphism**

* One interface, many implementations
* Behavior changes based on context

📌 **Types**:

| Type        | Description                       | Example                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Static**  | Compile-time (Method Overloading) | `run()`, `run(int speed)`   |
| **Dynamic** | Runtime (Method Overriding)       | `Tiger.run()`, `Duck.run()` |

**Dynamic Polymorphism Example:**

```java
class Animal {
  void run() { ... }
}
class Tiger extends Animal {
  void run() { System.out.println("Fast run"); }
}
```

**Static Polymorphism Example:**

```java
class Car {
  void accelerate() { ... }
  void accelerate(int speed) { ... }
}
```

---

## 🗂️ Summary Table

| Concept       | Meaning                       | Real-world Example         | Code Benefit       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Abstraction   | Hide details, show essentials | Driver starts car          | Cleaner interface  |
| Encapsulation | Bundle data + behavior        | Car has engine + functions | Secure and modular |
| Inheritance   | Child inherits parent         | ElectricCar → Car          | Code reuse         |
| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms          | Animal run(), diff run()   | Flexibility        |

---

## ✅ Final Takeaways

* **OOP bridges real-world concepts to code**
* **Objects** model real entities with data and behaviors
* Code becomes more **secure, modular, and extensible**
* Essential for **enterprise apps** like Uber, Ola, YouTube, etc.

# 🧠 UML Diagrams: 

### ✅ What is UML?

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** is a standard way to visualize the **design and structure of a system**.

* Used in **system analysis**, **design**, and **documentation**
* Helps teams understand system **architecture**, **data flow**, and **interactions**

---

## 🏛 1. **Structural Diagrams** (Static)

These represent the **static structure** of a system: **classes, objects, relationships**, etc.

### 🔸 1.1 **Class Diagram**

Shows the **classes** in a system and their **attributes, methods**, and **relationships**.

#### ✅ Class Structure Format:

```text
  +-----------------------------+
  |         <<abstract>>       |   <- (optional) stereotype
  |         ClassName          |   <- (Class name)
  +-----------------------------+
  | - privateVar: Type         |   <- Attributes
  | + publicVar: Type          |
  | # protectedVar: Type       |
  +-----------------------------+
  | + publicMethod(): Return   |   <- Methods
  | - privateMethod(): Return  |
  +-----------------------------+
```

**Access Modifiers:**

| Symbol | Meaning   |
| ------ | --------- |
| `+`    | Public    |
| `-`    | Private   |
| `#`    | Protected |

---

### 🔸 1.2 **Class Relationships** (Association)

#### 1. **Inheritance** ("Is-a")

* Used when one class **extends** another
* Represented with a **hollow arrow (`--|>`)**
* **Code Example**:

```cpp
class Animal {
  void speak();
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark();
}
```

```text
Animal
  ^
  -
  |
Dog
```

---

#### 2. **Object Association** ("Has-a")

##### a. **Simple Association**

* Two classes **interact** or **refer to** each other
* Represented with a **plain arrow (`-->`)**
* **Example**: Arjun lives in House

```cpp
class Arjun {
  House* home;
};
```

```text
Arjun --> House
```

---

##### b. **Aggregation**

* A **container-part** relationship
* Part **can exist independently**
* Represented with **hollow diamond (`o--`)**

**Example**:
Room contains Bed, Chair, Sofa – but these can exist separately.

```cpp
class Room {
  Chair chair;
};
```

```text
Room <>-- Chair
```

---

##### c. **Composition**

* **Strongest** "has-a" relationship
* Part **cannot exist without** the whole
* Represented with a **filled diamond (`◆--`)**

**Example**: Chair has Seat, Arms, Wheels – they don't exist independently.

```cpp
class Seat { };
class Arms { };
class Chair {
  private:
    Seat s;
    Arms a;
};
```

```text
Chair ◆-- Seat  
Chair ◆-- Arms
```

➡️ **Used heavily in LLD** (Low Level Design)

---


Here is a **detailed and structured explanation** of **UML Sequence Diagrams**, including every component with **clear meaning**, **visuals**, **sync/async message types**, and **real examples**.

---

# 🔄 2. **Dynamic Diagrams (Behavioral)**

## 🔹 2.1 **Sequence Diagram**

A **sequence diagram** models the **flow of logic** in a system **over time**.
It captures **how objects interact** through **method calls (messages)** in a specific **time order**.

---

## ✅ **Main Components of a Sequence Diagram**

### 1. **Objects (Actors or Instances)**

* Represented as **boxes at the top**
* These are **instances** of classes
* Can be **users, APIs, classes**, etc.

```text
+--------+     +--------+     +------------+
|  User  |     |  ATM   |     | BankServer |
+--------+     +--------+     +------------+
```

---

### 2. **Lifeline**

* Represented by a **dashed vertical line** below each object
* **Represents the life** of the object during the interaction
* Shows **when** and **how long** the object is **involved**
* **Starts** when the diagram begins and **ends** when the object is no longer active or is destroyed

```text
User        ATM         BankServer
 |           |              |
 |           |              |
 |           |              |
```

Each `|` below the object is a **lifeline**.

---

### 3. **Messages (Solid Arrows)**

Messages show **calls or data transfer** between objects.

#### 🔹 Types of Messages:

| Type             | Symbol              | Meaning                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Synchronous**  | Solid arrowhead `→` | Caller waits for response (blocking) |
| **Asynchronous** | Open arrowhead `↝`  | Caller continues without waiting     |
| **Return**       | Dotted line `--->`  | Response after sync call             |

---

#### ✅ Visual Representation:

```text
User       ATM           Bank
 |           |              |
 | --------> |              | insertCard()
 |           |              |
 |           | -------->    | verifyPIN()
 |           | <--------    | true/false
 | <-------- |              | result to user
```

* `→` = **sync call**
* `↝` = **async call**
* `--->` = **return message**

---

### 4. **Activation Bar**

* A **thin vertical rectangle** on lifeline
* Represents the **time duration a method is active/executing**
* Appears when an object **receives a message**
* Ends when the method completes

```text
     +----------+
User |          |
     |          |
     +----------+           +----------+
              → |           |          |
                | ATM       |          |
                +---------->+ Bank     |
                             |          |
                             +----------+
```

---

## 🧪 Real-World Example: ATM Transaction

```text
User        ATM        BankServer
 |           |              |
 | --------> |              |  insertCard()
 |           |              |
 |           | -------->    |  verifyPIN()
 |           | <--------    |  return result
 | <-------- |              |  show message
```

* All arrows `→` are **synchronous**
* Messages flow **top to bottom** in time

---

### 🔁 Optional Elements

#### a. **Asynchronous Calls**:

```text
App        Worker
 |  ↝       |       processRequest() – async
 |          |
```

Used in **event-driven systems**, like sending an email or logging.

---

#### b. **Return Message**:

```text
ATM         BankServer
 | -------->|
 |<-------- |  (returns boolean PIN check)
```

---

#### c. **Create and Destroy Object**:

* Creation:

```text
User → new ATM()
```

* Destruction:

```text
ATM x------> (object destroyed)
```

# System Design Interview Notes for Tech Analyst Role

## System Design Fundamentals

- **System Design** explains how to build scalable and reliable backend systems that handle real-world client needs.
- **Clients**: Devices like laptops, mobiles, IoT gadgets connect to backend systems via the internet.
- **Servers**: Handle requests, process data, and store information for client devices.

## Networking Basics

- **IP Address**: Numeric address identifying servers on the internet (like 192.168.1.1).
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates user-friendly domain names (e.g., amazon.com) into IP addresses; makes web navigation simple.

## Scaling

- **Vertical Scaling**
    - Increases the power (CPU, RAM) of a single server.
    - Pros: Quick to implement.
    - Cons: Downtime needed for upgrades; limited by maximum server capacity.
- **Horizontal Scaling**
    - Adds multiple servers to the system, distributing load.
    - Pros: No downtime; practically limitless scaling; improves fault tolerance.

## Load Balancers

- Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for efficiency and reliability.
- **Common algorithms**: Round-robin (equal distribution), least connections.
- Used by cloud services (like AWS Elastic Load Balancer) to route requests.

## API Gateway

- Acts as the single entry point for all client requests.
- Handles:
    - Routing to appropriate microservices
    - Authentication and security checks
    - Aggregating responses

## Microservices Architecture

- Breaks a large system into smaller, independently deployable components (e.g., auth, payments, orders).
- **Benefits**:
    - Independent scaling and deployment.
    - Greater fault isolation.

## Asynchronous Processing & Queues

- Used for background jobs (e.g., sending emails, processing file uploads) to avoid making clients wait.
- **Queue Systems**: AWS SQS is a popular example.
- **Polling Types**:
    - Push: Service delivers messages to workers.
    - Pull: Workers periodically check for new messages (short-poll, long-poll).

## Rate Limiting

- Controls the number of allowed requests (e.g., max 10 emails/second).
- Prevents overloading services and helps manage third-party API limitations.

## Event-Driven & Pub-Sub Architectures

- **Event**: A trigger (like user signup or payment) that initiates actions.
- **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub)**:
    - Publishers emit events; subscribers listen and react.
    - Tools: AWS SNS sends notifications to multiple destinations (email, SMS, etc.) from one event.

## Resilience Patterns

- **Dead Letter Queues**: Store failed tasks for later review or retry, ensuring no data is lost.
- **Message Acknowledgement**: Confirms successful processing of messages; enables retries if failures occur.

## Common System Design Terms

| Term                   | Definition                                                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scalability            | Ability of a system to handle increasing load by scaling up/out                        |
| Fault Tolerance        | System's capability to continue functioning when some components fail                  |
| Availability           | Percentage of time the system is operational and accessible to users                   |
| Latency                | Time taken for a request to travel from sender to receiver and back                    |
| Throughput             | Number of requests a system handles per second                                         |

## Best Practices for Interviews

- Start with a **clear problem statement**. Clarify user flows, scale, and functional requirements.
- Propose a **simple design first**. Justify choices, then address bottlenecks or scale.
- Communicate trade-offs (vertical vs. horizontal scaling, monolith vs. microservices).
- Diagram key components: clients, servers, load balancers, gateways, databases, microservices, queues.
- Discuss **failure handling** and **data consistency**.
- Be ready to answer questions about **cloud services**, **caching**, and **monitoring**.
