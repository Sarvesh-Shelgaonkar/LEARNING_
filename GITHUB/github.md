Hereâ€™s a **detailed but simple explanation** for each question so you can answer confidently in an interview:

---

### âœ… **1. Difference between Git and GitHub**

* **Git**:

  * A **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code.
  * Installed on your local machine.
  * Works even without the internet.
  * Examples of tasks: `git add`, `git commit`, `git merge`.

* **GitHub**:

  * A **cloud-based hosting platform** for Git repositories.
  * Enables **collaboration** among multiple developers.
  * Provides additional features like pull requests, issues, code reviews.

**In short**:
Git = tool for version control.
GitHub = platform to host and share Git repositories online.

---

### âœ… **2. Workflow: How to push local code to GitHub**

**Step 1:** Initialize local repo

```bash
git init
```

**Step 2:** Add files to staging area

```bash
git add .
```

**Step 3:** Commit changes

```bash
git commit -m "First commit"
```

**Step 4:** Connect local repo to remote GitHub repo

```bash
git remote add origin <repo-URL>
```

**Step 5:** Push changes to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

ðŸ‘‰ After first push, next time you can just do:

```bash
git push
```

---

### âœ… **3. What happens in `git add` vs `git commit`**

* **`git add`**:

  * Moves changes from **Working Directory** â†’ **Staging Area**.
  * Prepares the files for commit.
* **`git commit`**:

  * Moves changes from **Staging Area** â†’ **Local Repository**.
  * Creates a snapshot of your code with a message.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like:
**`add` = selecting items in a shopping cart**
**`commit` = making the payment (finalizing the selection)**.

---

### âœ… **4. Explain Branches and Merging**

* **Branch**:

  * A **separate line of development**.
  * Default branch is usually `main` or `master`.
  * Allows working on features without affecting the main code.

**Create branch**:

```bash
git branch feature-branch
```

**Switch to branch**:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

* **Merge**:

  * Combines changes from one branch into another.
  * Example: Merge feature branch into main:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-branch
    ```

---

### âœ… **5. Merge vs Rebase**

* **Merge**:

  * Creates a **new merge commit** combining histories.
  * Keeps full history (with branching structure).
* **Rebase**:

  * Moves your commits **on top of another branch**.
  * Creates a **linear history** (cleaner but rewrites history).

**When to use?**

* Merge â†’ For team work, safe, preserves history.
* Rebase â†’ For clean history before pushing (on personal branches).

---

### âœ… **6. Reset vs Revert**

* **Reset**:

  * Moves HEAD to a previous commit.
  * **Can erase history** (dangerous on shared branches).
  * Types:

    * `--soft`: Keeps changes staged.
    * `--mixed`: Keeps changes in working directory.
    * `--hard`: Deletes changes completely.

Example:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-id>
```

* **Revert**:

  * Creates a **new commit that undoes changes** of a previous commit.
  * **Safe for shared branches**.

Example:

```bash
git revert <commit-id>
```

---

### âœ… **7. How to resolve merge conflicts**

**Merge conflict happens when:**

* Two branches edit the same line of a file.

**Steps to resolve:**

1. Open the file and look for conflict markers:

   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   your changes
   =======
   their changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```
2. Edit the file to keep correct code.
3. Stage and commit:

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git commit
   ```

---

### âœ… **8. Why use Pull Request?**

* Pull Request (PR) = **asking to merge your changes** into someone elseâ€™s branch (often `main`).
* Advantages:

  * Code review before merging.
  * Discuss changes with team.
  * Maintains quality and prevents direct changes to main.

---

### âœ… **9. What is Stash, When do you use it?**

* **Stash** = Temporarily saving uncommitted changes without committing them.
* Useful when:

  * You need to switch branches but donâ€™t want to commit incomplete work.

**Commands:**

```bash
git stash       # save changes
git stash pop   # apply changes and remove from stash
git stash list  # see stashed changes
```
