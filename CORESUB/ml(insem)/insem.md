# ‚ú® 1. Compare ML with Traditional Programming (8 Marks)

| **Aspect**       | **Traditional Programming**                            | **Machine Learning**                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**        | Data + Rules (logic coded by programmer)               | Data + Output (labels/examples)                           |
| **Output**       | Program produces output based on rules                 | ML algorithm learns rules/model                           |

| **Adaptability** | Cannot adapt to new unseen cases without reprogramming | Can generalize and adapt to unseen data                   |
| **Examples**     | Calculator, Banking Transaction Systems                | Spam detection, Image recognition, Recommendation systems |

‚úÖ **Summary**:

# ‚ú® 6. Explain Geometric and Probabilistic Models with Examples

* **Geometric Model**

  * Idea: Classify data based on **distance/geometry** in feature space.

    * SVM ‚Üí finds the best separating hyperplane.

* **Probabilistic Model**

  * Idea: Use **probability theory** to model data and predict outcomes.
  * Example:

    * Naive Bayes ‚Üí classifies emails as spam/not spam based on probability of words.
    * Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

‚úÖ Difference:

* Geometric ‚Üí Based on space and distance.
* Probabilistic ‚Üí Based on likelihood and probability distributions.

3. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Üí Clean, normalize, handle missing values, feature extraction.
4. **Splitting Data** ‚Üí Train set and Test set.
5. **Model Selection** ‚Üí Choose algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
6. **Training** ‚Üí Feed training data to learn patterns.
