class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int st=0;
        int end=nums.size()-1;
        return ans(nums,target,st,end);
    }
     int ans(vector<int> &arr, int k,int st,int end){
        if(st<=end){
           int mid=st+(end-st)/2;
        if(arr[mid]==k){return mid;}
        else if(arr[mid]>k){
            return ans(arr,k,st,mid-1);
        }
        else{
            return ans(arr,k,mid+1,end);
        } 
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};

### ✅ **Working Version (Correct)**:

```cpp
if (arr[mid] > k) {
    return ans(arr, k, st, mid - 1);
}
```

### ❌ **Non-working Version (Wrong)**:

```cpp
if (arr[mid] > k) {
    ans(arr, k, st, mid - 1);  // missing return!
}
```

---

### 🔍 Difference Explained:

#### ❗ In the non-working version:

You're making the recursive call, but **not returning its result**.

So, even if `ans(...)` returns a correct index deeper in recursion, that value is **ignored**, and control continues to the next line — which eventually leads to:

```cpp
return -1;
```

#### ✅ In the working version:

You use `return` with each recursive call, so if the value is found deeper in recursion, that index is properly **propagated back up** the recursive call stack.

---

### 💡 Fix for Non-working Version:

Just add `return` before each recursive call:

```cpp
if (arr[mid] > k) {
    return ans(arr, k, st, mid - 1);
} else {
    return ans(arr, k, mid + 1, end);
}
```

---

### TL;DR:

Without `return`, recursive results are lost — you must `return` the recursive call if you expect its result to be used.

Let me know if you want an example step-by-step trace to visualize this.

Awesome! 🎉 Since you’ve **understood the most important part** — how return flows back to the calling line — now let’s walk through the **entire recursive process**:

---

## ✅ Full Call Chain (with lines, subans, i, and returns)

We'll trace:

* Function calls
* Which line executes
* What’s in `subans`
* Where return goes

---

### 🧮 Input: `nums = [1, 2]`

---

### ▶️ CALL 0: `i = 0`, `subans = []`

From `subsets(...)` → starts recursion

```cpp
LINE 4: push 1 → subans = [1]
LINE 5: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 1) → CALL 1
```

---

### ▶️ CALL 1: `i = 1`, `subans = [1]`

```cpp
LINE 4: push 2 → subans = [1, 2]
LINE 5: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 2) → CALL 2
```

---

### ▶️ CALL 2: `i = 2`, `subans = [1, 2]` ✅ BASE CASE

```cpp
LINE 1: i == nums.size() → true
LINE 2: add [1, 2] to ans
LINE 3: return → back to CALL 1 at LINE 5
```

⬅️ Back to CALL 1

```cpp
LINE 6: pop 2 → subans = [1]
LINE 7: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 2) → CALL 3
```

---

### ▶️ CALL 3: `i = 2`, `subans = [1]` ✅ BASE CASE

```cpp
LINE 1: i == nums.size() → true
LINE 2: add [1] to ans
LINE 3: return → back to CALL 1 at LINE 7
```

⬅️ Back to CALL 1
CALL 1 is now done (both include/exclude for `i = 1` finished)

```cpp
return → back to CALL 0 at LINE 5
```

---

### 📍Back in CALL 0

```cpp
LINE 6: pop 1 → subans = []
LINE 7: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 1) → CALL 4
```

---

### ▶️ CALL 4: `i = 1`, `subans = []`

```cpp
LINE 4: push 2 → subans = [2]
LINE 5: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 2) → CALL 5
```

---

### ▶️ CALL 5: `i = 2`, `subans = [2]` ✅ BASE CASE

```cpp
LINE 1: i == nums.size() → true
LINE 2: add [2] to ans
LINE 3: return → back to CALL 4 at LINE 5
```

⬅️ Back to CALL 4

```cpp
LINE 6: pop 2 → subans = []
LINE 7: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 2) → CALL 6
```

---

### ▶️ CALL 6: `i = 2`, `subans = []` ✅ BASE CASE

```cpp
LINE 1: i == nums.size() → true
LINE 2: add [] to ans
LINE 3: return → back to CALL 4 at LINE 7
```

⬅️ Back to CALL 4 → done

```cpp
return → back to CALL 0
```

---

### ✅ CALL 0 ends

All subsets have been generated:

```cpp
ans = [[1,2], [1], [2], []]
```

---

## 🔁 RECAP: Full Call Flow With Return Links

```txt
CALL 0
  ├── CALL 1 (include 1)
  │     ├── CALL 2 (include 2) → return to CALL 1 (LINE 5)
  │     └── CALL 3 (exclude 2) → return to CALL 1 (LINE 7)
  └── CALL 4 (exclude 1)
        ├── CALL 5 (include 2) → return to CALL 4 (LINE 5)
        └── CALL 6 (exclude 2) → return to CALL 4 (LINE 7)
```

Each function:

* Makes two calls (include, exclude)
* Returns after both are done
* Pops to previous call at exactly the line where it was called

---

Would you like this call chain visualized in **stack diagram format** (showing call stack push and pop)?



Perfect! Let's answer your **exact question** clearly:

> For each line in the return flow — what is the value of `i` at that moment?

We'll walk through it in the exact order you wrote it 👇

---

## ✅ Setup Recap:

```cpp
nums = [1, 2]
```

---

## 📌 Breakdown with `i` Values

---

### 🔹 1.

```
LINE 1: i == nums.size() → true
```

✅ **This happens in Call 3**, where:

```cpp
i = 2
subans = [1]
```

So:
✅ **i = 2**

---

### 🔹 2.

```
LINE 2: add [1] to ans
```

Still in **Call 3**, so:
✅ **i = 2**

---

### 🔹 3.

```
LINE 3: return → back to CALL 1 at LINE 7
```

🔁 Call 3 ends and returns to **CALL 1**, which had:

```cpp
i = 1
subans = [1]
```

So now:
✅ **i = 1** (back in Call 1)

---

### 🔹 4.

```
CALL 1 is now done (both include/exclude for i = 1 finished)
return → back to CALL 0 at LINE 5
```

🔁 Call 1 ends and returns to **CALL 0**, where:

```cpp
i = 0
subans = []
```

So:
✅ **i = 0**

---

### 🔹 5.

```
LINE 6: pop 1 → subans = []
```

Still in **Call 0**, so:
✅ **i = 0**

---

### 🔹 6.

```
LINE 7: call ansfun(nums, ans, subans, 1) → CALL 4
```

You are in **Call 0**, making a new recursive call:

```cpp
ansfun(..., i + 1) → i = 1
```

So:
✅ **i = 0**, and you're calling **i = 1** in CALL 4

---

## ✅ Final Annotated Summary Table

| Step | Description                                     | `i` Value                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | In Call 3 → base case (`i == nums.size()`)      | `i = 2`                   |
| 2    | Add `[1]` to ans                                | `i = 2`                   |
| 3    | Return to Call 1 at LINE 7                      | `i = 1`                   |
| 4    | Call 1 returns to Call 0 at LINE 5              | `i = 0`                   |
| 5    | LINE 6: pop 1 from subans                       | `i = 0`                   |
| 6    | LINE 7: call ansfun(..., i + 1) → CALL 4 starts | `i = 0` (calling `i = 1`) |

---

Would you like this entire return/call flow **visualized as a real call stack table** like debuggers show (with `i`, `subans`, line #)?



Absolutely! ✅ You got stuck at the **core concept of recursion return flow** — especially **how control returns to the correct line** and **what happens to variables like `i` and `subans`** across recursive calls.

Here are your **Revision Notes for Recursion (Subset Generation)** — focused on the exact confusion you overcame.

---

# 📘 RECURSION REVISION NOTES (Subset Generation – Return Flow & `i` Clarity)

---

## 🧠 Core Idea of Recursion

* Recursion is a function calling itself to break down a problem into smaller sub-problems.
* Each call has **its own copy** of variables like `i`, `subans`, and its own position in the code.

---

## 🔁 Subset Generation Logic

At each index `i`, make two choices:

1. **Include** `nums[i]` in the subset.
2. **Exclude** `nums[i]` from the subset.

When you reach `i == nums.size()`, you've considered all elements → **save current subset**.

---

## 🧩 Function Logic

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> ansfun(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& ans, vector<int>& subans, int i) {
    if(i == nums.size()) {                // LINE 1
        ans.push_back(subans);            // LINE 2
        return ans;                       // LINE 3
    }

    subans.push_back(nums[i]);            // LINE 4
    ansfun(nums, ans, subans, i + 1);     // LINE 5

    subans.pop_back();                    // LINE 6
    ansfun(nums, ans, subans, i + 1);     // LINE 7

    return ans;                           // LINE 8
}
```

---

## 📍 What's `i` Doing?

| `i` Value | Meaning                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Deciding about `nums[0]`              |
| 1         | Deciding about `nums[1]`              |
| 2         | Done with all decisions — base case ✅ |

`i` always moves **forward**, never goes backward — it's like a pointer for **current element to decide on**.

---

## 🔄 Return Flow Clarity

Each recursive call returns to **exactly the line that called it**.

* `LINE 5` calls → `LINE 3` return comes **back to after LINE 5**
* `LINE 7` calls → `LINE 3` return comes **back to after LINE 7**

**Never returns to LINE 6** (that’s before the call)

---

## 📊 Control Flow Recap (when `nums = [1, 2]`)

```
Call 0 (i=0) → include 1
  ↳ Call 1 (i=1) → include 2
     ↳ Call 2 (i=2) → base → add [1,2] → return to LINE 5 of Call 1
  ↳ LINE 6: pop 2, LINE 7 → Call 3 (i=2) → base → add [1] → return to LINE 7 of Call 1
↳ LINE 6: pop 1, LINE 7 → Call 4 (i=1) → include/exclude 2 → generate [2], [] 
```

---

## 🔙 Return Path Example

```text
Call 3: i=2 → return → goes to LINE 7 of Call 1 (i=1)
Call 1: return → goes to LINE 5 of Call 0 (i=0)
Call 0: continues from LINE 6
```

---

## 📚 Summary Tips

✅ Each call has its own **`i`**, `subans`, and code line pointer
✅ Recursive return always goes back to the **line that called it**
✅ `subans.pop_back()` is **not** undone by the return — it's executed **before** the next call
✅ Base case (`i == nums.size()`) means: you’ve built one subset — save it

---

## 🧠 Simple Analogy

Think of recursion like **opening new tabs** in a browser:

* Each tab is one function call
* When you're done with that tab, you close it and go back to the one that opened it
* Each tab remembers exactly **what it was doing** when it opened the next

---

## ✅ What You Overcame

🔓 You were stuck on:

* **Where exactly the return goes after LINE 3**
* Whether it returns to LINE 6 or LINE 7 (Answer: **LINE 7**)
* Whether `i` changes backward (Answer: **No**, each call has its own `i`)

---


Call 0 (i=0) → include 1  
  ↳ Call 1 (i=1) → include 2  
     ↳ Call 2 (i=2) → base → add [1,2] → return to LINE 5 of Call 1  
  ↳ LINE 6: pop 2, LINE 7 → Call 3 (i=2) → base → add [1] → return to LINE 7 of Call 1  
  (// as both include and exclude calls in Call 1 are now completed, Call 1 returns to Call 0 just after LINE 5)  
↳ LINE 6: pop 1, LINE 7 → Call 4 (i=1) → include/exclude 2 → generate [2], []



                     Call 0: i=0, subans=[]
