Got it 👍 Since you’ve added **C++, Java, and JavaScript** in your resume, interviewers will expect you to be **confident in fundamentals, OOP concepts, problem-solving, and a bit of language-specific knowledge**.

I’ll give you a **complete roadmap** for your technical interview prep (structured + detailed), so you don’t miss anything.

---

# 🔹 1. Core Programming Fundamentals (Language-Independent)

These are **must-know** since they’re often asked across C++, Java, and JavaScript:

* **Data Types & Variables**

  * Primitive vs reference types
  * Memory size of types in C++ & Java
  * JavaScript dynamic typing
* **Operators**

  * Arithmetic, logical, relational
  * Pre/post increment differences
* **Control Statements**

  * if-else, switch, loops, break vs continue
* **Functions & Scope**

  * Pass by value vs pass by reference
  * Function overloading/overriding (C++/Java)
  * Default parameters (C++), optional parameters (JavaScript)

---

# 🔹 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Be ready to explain & give examples (in **any language** they ask):

1. **4 Pillars of OOP**

   * **Encapsulation** → getters & setters
   * **Inheritance** → IS-A relationship
   * **Polymorphism** → Overloading vs Overriding
   * **Abstraction** → Abstract classes, interfaces
2. **Key Questions**

   * Difference: Abstract class vs Interface
   * Why multiple inheritance not allowed in Java? (But allowed in C++ with ambiguity issues)
   * Method hiding vs Overriding
   * Virtual functions in C++
   * Constructors vs Destructors
   * Final keyword in Java
   * Garbage collection in Java vs manual memory management in C++

---

# 🔹 3. Language-Specific Focus

Since you mentioned **C++, Java, JavaScript**, they may ask **comparisons** too.

### ✅ C++

* Pointers, references, memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)
* `struct` vs `class`
* Shallow vs deep copy
* Virtual functions & vtable
* Templates (function & class)
* Exception handling (`try-catch`)
* Standard Template Library (STL): `vector`, `map`, `set`

### ✅ Java

* JVM, JDK, JRE differences
* Memory management (stack, heap, garbage collector)
* Exception hierarchy (checked vs unchecked)
* Collections framework: List, Set, Map, Queue
* Multithreading: `synchronized`, thread lifecycle
* `==` vs `.equals()`
* String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

### ✅ JavaScript

* **Execution Model** → Call stack, Event loop, Callback queue
* **Hoisting** → var vs let vs const
* Closures & lexical scope
* Prototypal inheritance
* Asynchronous JS: callback, promise, async/await
* DOM manipulation basics
* ES6 features (arrow functions, spread/rest, destructuring)
* `==` vs `===`

---

# 🔹 4. Data Structures & Algorithms

Expect at least 2–3 **coding problems** in interviews. Prepare:

### Arrays & Strings

* Reverse array, rotate array
* Find duplicate / missing number
* Subarray with given sum
* Two-pointer problems (pair sum, remove duplicates)
* String reversal, palindrome, anagram check

### Linked List

* Reverse linked list
* Detect loop (Floyd’s cycle detection)
* Merge two sorted linked lists
* Middle of linked list

### Stacks & Queues

* Implement stack using array/linked list
* Balanced parentheses
* Next greater element
* Queue using two stacks

### Trees & Graphs

* Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
* Height of binary tree
* Binary Search Tree (insert, search)
* Graph traversal (DFS, BFS)

### Searching & Sorting

* Binary search (with variations: first/last occurrence, rotated array)
* Merge sort, Quick sort
* Sorting algorithms’ complexities

### Dynamic Programming (basic)

* Fibonacci (memoization & tabulation)
* Longest Common Subsequence
* Knapsack (basic version)

# 🔹 5. System & Language Comparisons

They love asking **“Which language would you use for X?”**

* **C++** → System-level programming, high performance
* **Java** → Platform independence, large-scale apps
* **JavaScript** → Web development, frontend/backend (Node.js)

---

# 🔹 6. Databases & SQL (basic prep)

Even if not on resume, they may test your basics:

* CRUD operations (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
* Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
* Aggregates (`COUNT`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`)
* Subqueries
* Primary key vs Foreign key

---

# 🔹 7. Operating Systems & Networking (basic)

* Process vs Thread
* Deadlock conditions
* Paging vs Segmentation
* TCP vs UDP
* HTTP vs HTTPS
* REST API basics

---

# 🔹 8. HR + Resume Defense

Since you’ve listed these skills, be ready for:

* **“Rate yourself in C++, Java, JavaScript”**
* **“Which one is your strongest language?”**
* **“Tell me about a project where you used \[language]”**
* **“Why three different languages instead of mastering one?”**

👉 Answer confidently: say you explored different languages to understand **system-level (C++), application-level (Java), and web-level (JavaScript)** programming.

# 🔹 9. Mock Interview Prep (How to Answer)

1. Repeat question to confirm understanding.
2. Start with a brute force approach, then optimize.
3. Write clean code with comments.
4. Discuss time & space complexity.
5. Handle edge cases (empty input, null, negatives).

⚡ My suggestion:
We can do **mock Q\&A sessions** — I’ll act as interviewer and ask you coding + theory questions from **C++, Java, and JS**. That way, you’ll get real interview practice.

Do you want me to first prepare **a list of top 50+ coding questions** (with solutions) that you must practice, or start with a **mock interview session** right now?
