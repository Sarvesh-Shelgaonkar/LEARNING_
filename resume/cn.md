Got it 👍 You’re preparing for **Associate Software Developer interviews** and want me to teach you **Computer Networks (CN)**.

Let’s do this step by step like a guided crash course — I’ll explain **in easy English** with **examples**, **interview-style Q\&A**, and **diagrams (where needed)**.

## 📘 Computer Networks Crash Course for Interviews

### 1. **Basics of Networking**

* **Computer Network** = Collection of computers/devices connected together to share data and resources.
* **Main Goals** → Communication, Resource Sharing, Reliability, Speed.

**Types of Networks:**

* **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small area (office, home).
* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** City-level.
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Country/world-level (Internet).

👉 *Interview Q:*
**Q:** What is a computer network?
**A:** A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources using communication links.

---

### 2. **Network Models**

Two main models describe how networks work:

1. **OSI Model (7 Layers)**

   * **Application** → User interaction (browser, apps).
   * **Presentation** → Data format/encoding (encryption, compression).
   * **Session** → Connection setup, maintenance.
   * **Transport** → Reliability, segmentation (TCP/UDP).
   * **Network** → Routing (IP addresses).
   * **Data Link** → Error detection, MAC addresses.
   * **Physical** → Cables, signals, hardware.

2. **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**

   * **Application**
   * **Transport**
   * **Internet**
   * **Network Access**

👉 *Interview Q:*
**Q:** Difference between OSI and TCP/IP?
**A:** OSI has 7 layers (theoretical), TCP/IP has 4 layers (practical). OSI is a reference model, TCP/IP is implementation.

---

### 3. **IP Addressing**

* **IPv4:** 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
* **IPv6:** 128-bit address (newer, larger).
* **Private IP:** Used inside LAN (`192.168.x.x`).
* **Public IP:** Used on Internet.

👉 *Interview Q:*
**Q:** Difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
**A:** IPv4 is 32-bit (4 billion addresses), IPv6 is 128-bit (huge, almost unlimited). IPv6 also has built-in security (IPSec).

---

### 4. **TCP vs UDP**

* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**

  * Connection-oriented
  * Reliable (acknowledgements, retransmissions)
  * Example: Web browsing, Email

* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**

  * Connectionless
  * Faster but unreliable
  * Example: Video streaming, Gaming, VoIP

👉 *Interview Q:*
**Q:** When would you use UDP over TCP?
**A:** In real-time apps (video calls, online gaming) where speed matters more than reliability.

---

### 5. **Routing & Switching**

* **Router:** Connects different networks, works with IP addresses.
* **Switch:** Connects devices in the same network (LAN), works with MAC addresses.
* **Hub:** Basic device, broadcasts to all.

👉 *Interview Q:*
**Q:** Difference between Router and Switch?
**A:** Router works at network layer, directs packets between networks. Switch works at data link layer, forwards data inside a LAN.

---

### 6. **DNS, DHCP & Protocols**

* **DNS (Domain Name System):** Converts website names to IP (`google.com → 142.250.190.78`).
* **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automatically assigns IP to devices.
* **HTTP/HTTPS:** Communication protocol for web.
* **FTP:** File transfer protocol.
* **SMTP/IMAP/POP3:** Email protocols.

---

### 7. **Firewalls & Security**

* **Firewall:** Filters traffic (allow/deny).
* **Encryption:** Protects data.
* **VPN:** Secure tunnel over the Internet.

👉 *Interview Q:*
**Q:** What is a firewall?
**A:** A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on rules.

---

### 8. **Common Interview Questions**

1. What is the difference between hub, switch, and router?
2. Explain OSI vs TCP/IP model.
3. TCP vs UDP — which is faster and why?
4. What is subnetting?

⚡ I can now:

* Go **topic by topic in detail** (with small examples + diagrams), OR
* Do a **Q\&A style revision** for quick interview prep, OR
* Give you **practice problems & scenarios** (like “Explain the journey of a packet”).

👉 Slavanya, how would you like me to proceed — deep teaching step by step 📖, or interview Q\&A style 🔍, or mix of both?



Perfect 👌 These are **classic Computer Networks interview questions**.
I’ll give you **clear, short, but detailed-enough answers** with analogies so you can remember easily in interviews.

---

## 1️⃣ Difference between Hub, Switch, and Router

* **Hub**

  * Dumb device: broadcasts data to all ports.
  * Works at **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**.
  * No traffic filtering, less secure.

* **Switch**

  * Smarter: sends data only to the destination device using **MAC address**.
  * Works at **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**.
  * Reduces collisions, faster than hub.

* **Router**

  * Connects **different networks** (LAN ↔ Internet).
  * Works at **Network Layer (Layer 3)**.
  * Uses **IP addresses** for packet forwarding.

👉 **Analogy:**
Hub = megaphone shouting to everyone.
Switch = calling only the right friend in the room.
Router = post office that delivers between cities.

---

## 2️⃣ OSI vs TCP/IP Model

* **OSI (7 Layers – Theoretical)**

  * Layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.
  * Generic, not implemented fully.

* **TCP/IP (4 Layers – Practical)**

  * Layers: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access.
  * Real-world implementation used in the Internet.

👉 **Key Difference:**
OSI = Reference Model.
TCP/IP = Implementation Model.

---

## 3️⃣ TCP vs UDP — which is faster and why?

* **TCP:**

  * Connection-oriented, reliable, acknowledgment-based.
  * Slower because of extra overhead (handshakes, error checking).

* **UDP:**

  * Connectionless, no acknowledgments, no handshakes.
  * Faster because it just sends data without checks.

👉 **Answer:**
UDP is faster because it doesn’t wait for acknowledgments or establish a connection.

---

## 4️⃣ What is Subnetting?

* **Subnetting** = Dividing a large network into smaller networks (subnets).
* Helps in **efficient IP address usage**, improves **security**, and reduces **broadcast traffic**.

👉 Example:
`192.168.1.0/24` → can be split into:

* `192.168.1.0/26`
* `192.168.1.64/26`
* `192.168.1.128/26`
* `192.168.1.192/26`

---

## 5️⃣ What is DNS and how does it work?

* **DNS (Domain Name System)** = Translates human-readable names into IP addresses.

👉 Process:

1. You type `www.google.com`.
2. Browser checks local cache.
3. If not found → Query goes to DNS resolver (your ISP).
4. Resolver asks root server → TLD server (.com) → Google’s authoritative server.
5. Server responds with Google’s IP.
6. Browser connects to that IP.

👉 **Analogy:** DNS is like your phone’s contact list (name → phone number).

---

## 6️⃣ Difference between IPv4 and IPv6

* **IPv4:**

  * 32-bit, 4.3 billion addresses.
  * Example: `192.168.1.1`
  * Needs NAT to extend usage.

* **IPv6:**

  * 128-bit, almost unlimited addresses.
  * Example: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
  * Built-in security (IPSec), no NAT needed.

---

## 7️⃣ What happens when you type `www.google.com` in a browser?

👉 Step by step:

1. **DNS Lookup** → Resolve `www.google.com` to IP.
2. **TCP/UDP Connection** → Usually TCP 3-way handshake.
3. **TLS/SSL Handshake** (if HTTPS).
4. **HTTP Request** → Browser sends GET request.
5. **Server Response** → Google’s server sends HTML/CSS/JS.
6. **Rendering** → Browser parses and displays page.

---

## 8️⃣ What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?

* **ARP** maps **IP Address → MAC Address**.
* Example:

  * Your PC wants to talk to `192.168.1.5`.
  * It sends an **ARP request**: “Who has 192.168.1.5?”
  * The device replies with its MAC address.
  * Now communication happens at data link level.

👉 **Analogy:**
You know your friend’s house number (IP), but you ask neighbors for exact door location (MAC).
