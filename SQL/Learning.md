# **Comprehensive SQL Interview Preparation Notes**

---

## ✅ 1. Introduction to SQL

### 🔍 Explanation

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language to interact with relational databases. It is used for querying, inserting, updating, deleting data, as well as creating and managing schema objects like tables, views, and indexes.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** How to detect and fix SQL injection vulnerabilities?
  **A:** Test inputs like `' OR 1=1--`. Fix using prepared statements/parameterized queries and ORM frameworks.
* **Q:** How to get the 2nd highest salary without `TOP` or `LIMIT`?
  **A:**

  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);
  ```
* **Q:** What happens if you `SELECT *` on a BLOB column?
  **A:** Returns unreadable data or crashes client. Avoid fetching heavy binary columns unless needed.

---

## ✅ 2. SQL Data Types

### 🔍 Explanation

Columns have data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN, etc.) defining the kind of data stored and its size.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    JoinDate DATE
);
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary, JoinDate) VALUES (1, 'Anu', 50000.00, '2023-01-01');
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** How to store ₹10 crore with 4 decimals?
  **A:** Use `DECIMAL(14,4)`; avoid FLOAT for currency to prevent rounding errors.
* **Q:** What if you insert a string into an INT column?
  **A:** Depends on DBMS; MySQL converts `'123abc'` to `123`; some throw errors.
* **Q:** When use CHAR over VARCHAR?
  **A:** For fixed-length data like country codes (`'IN'`, `'US'`), CHAR is faster.

---

## ✅ 3. Data Definition Language (DDL)

### 🔍 Explanation

DDL commands create, alter, and drop database schema objects like tables, indexes, and constraints.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50));
ALTER TABLE Departments ADD Location VARCHAR(100);
DROP TABLE Departments;
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (Salary > 0);
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** Difference between DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE?
  **A:**

  * `DROP`: removes table and data permanently
  * `TRUNCATE`: deletes all rows, resets identity, faster but no WHERE clause
  * `DELETE`: deletes rows with WHERE, transactional
* **Q:** How to modify a column type safely?
  **A:** Use `ALTER TABLE MODIFY COLUMN`, ensure existing data compatibility first.
* **Q:** How to rename a table without data loss?
  **A:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE old_name RENAME TO new_name;
  ```

---

## ✅ 4. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### 🔍 Explanation

DML modifies data inside tables — includes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (...);
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 60000 WHERE ID = 2;
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 3;
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary) VALUES (5, 'Amit', 70000);
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** How to insert data from one table to another with a condition?
  **A:**

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO HighEarners (ID, Name, Salary)
  SELECT ID, Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 100000;
  ```
* **Q:** Can you rollback a DELETE?
  **A:** Yes, if inside a transaction that’s not committed, use `ROLLBACK`.
* **Q:** What is MERGE?
  **A:** A command combining INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, useful for upsert operations.

---

## ✅ 5. Data Query Language (DQL)

### 🔍 Explanation

DQL primarily includes the `SELECT` statement to read data.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Finance';
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What is the logical processing order of a SQL SELECT?
  **A:** FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY
* **Q:** Can GROUP BY be used without aggregates?
  **A:** Yes, but usually combined with aggregate functions.
* **Q:** Difference between DISTINCT and GROUP BY?
  **A:** DISTINCT removes duplicates; GROUP BY groups rows for aggregation.

---

## ✅ 6. Aggregate Functions

### 🔍 Explanation

Functions that return a single result from multiple rows: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees;
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** Why might `AVG(Salary)` return NULL?
  **A:** If all values in Salary are NULL.
* **Q:** COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column)?
  **A:** COUNT(*) counts all rows; COUNT(column) ignores NULL values.
* **Q:** Can aggregates be used in WHERE?
  **A:** No, use HAVING instead.

---

## ✅ 7. Joins

### 🔍 Explanation

Joins combine data from two or more tables based on related columns.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.DeptName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.ID;
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name FROM Employees e LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.ID;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** Explain SELF JOIN.
  **A:** Joining a table to itself, e.g., manager and employee:

  ```sql
  SELECT A.Name AS Manager, B.Name AS Employee
  FROM Employees A JOIN Employees B ON A.ID = B.ManagerID;
  ```
* **Q:** What does LEFT JOIN return if no match?
  **A:** NULLs for right table columns.
* **Q:** Can JOIN cause Cartesian product?
  **A:** Yes, if ON condition missing or CROSS JOIN used.

---

## ✅ 8. Subqueries

### 🔍 Explanation

Queries nested inside another query, in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** Correlated vs non-correlated subquery?
  **A:** Correlated depends on outer query row; non-correlated runs once independently.
* **Q:** Can subqueries return multiple values?
  **A:** Yes, with `IN`, `ANY`, or `ALL` operators.

---

## ✅ 9. Window Functions

### 🔍 Explanation

Perform calculations across a set (window) of rows related to current row.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
SELECT Name, Salary,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
FROM Employees;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** RANK vs DENSE\_RANK vs ROW\_NUMBER?
  **A:**

  * RANK: gaps in ranking on ties
  * DENSE\_RANK: no gaps
  * ROW\_NUMBER: unique sequential numbers
* **Q:** Purpose of LAG and LEAD?
  **A:** Access previous/next row’s values within partition.

---

## ✅ 10. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### 🔍 Explanation

Named temporary result sets for readability and reusability in complex queries.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
WITH HighSalary AS (
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM HighSalary;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What is a recursive CTE?
  **A:** CTE calling itself, useful for hierarchical data.
* **Q:** Are CTEs better than subqueries?
  **A:** Yes, for readability and reuse.

---

## ✅ 11. Transactions

### 🔍 Explanation

Group multiple SQL commands into atomic units following ACID properties.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 80000 WHERE ID = 1;
COMMIT;
```

### 📌 Use Case

Rollback on error:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 1000 WHERE ID = 1;
-- error occurs
ROLLBACK;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** How to ensure money transfer consistency?
  **A:** Use transaction wrapping all updates with COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
* **Q:** Explain isolation levels and trade-offs.
  **A:** READ UNCOMMITTED < READ COMMITTED < REPEATABLE READ < SERIALIZABLE; more isolation = less concurrency.
* **Q:** When to use SAVEPOINT?
  **A:** Partial rollbacks inside large transactions.

---

## ✅ 12. Indexing

### 🔍 Explanation

Data structures speeding up data retrieval on columns.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON Employees(Name);
```

### 📌 Use Case

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_multi ON Employees(DeptID, Salary);
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** When can indexes hurt?
  **A:** Slow down inserts/updates due to extra maintenance overhead.
* **Q:** What is a covering index?
  **A:** Index contains all queried columns, so no table lookup needed.
* **Q:** Clustered vs Non-clustered index?
  **A:** Clustered changes row order (one per table), non-clustered is separate structure.

---

## ✅ 13. Views & Materialized Views

### 🔍 Explanation

* View: Virtual table defined by a query.
* Materialized View: Physical stored query result, refreshed periodically.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE IsActive = 1;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** Can views be updated?
  **A:** Yes, if simple and based on one table without aggregates.
* **Q:** Use of materialized views?
  **A:** For caching expensive queries, improving performance.

---

## ✅ 14. Query Optimization

### 🔍 Explanation

Improving query speed and resource usage.

### 💡 Tips

* Use EXPLAIN to analyze query plan.
* Add selective indexes.
* Avoid `SELECT *`.

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What to look for in EXPLAIN?
  **A:** Scan type, join order, filters, sorting cost.
* **Q:** How to optimize large table queries?
  **A:** Index WHERE columns, partition tables, break queries, cache static data.

---

## ✅ 15. SQL Constraints

### 🔍 Explanation

Rules on data: PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY.

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
);
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** UNIQUE vs PRIMARY KEY?
  **A:** PRIMARY KEY = UNIQUE + NOT NULL, only one per table; UNIQUE allows multiple NULLs.
* **Q:** Can CHECK refer other tables?
  **A:** No, use triggers for cross-table validation.

---

## ✅ 16. Triggers

### 🔍 Explanation

Procedures run automatically on data changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).

### 🔠 Syntax Example

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER afterInsert
AFTER INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO AuditLog(...) VALUES (...);
END;
```

### 🔥 Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** Can triggers impact performance?
  **A:** Yes, especially nested triggers or heavy logic.
* **Q:** BEFORE vs AFTER triggers?
  **A:** BEFORE for validation; AFTER for logging or syncing.

---

## ✅ 17. Stored Procedures

Absolutely! Here are clean, structured **SQL interview notes** for Leetcode **Problem 1378 – Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier**, perfect for quick revision or explaining to an interviewer.

---

## 📝 SQL Notes – **Replace Employee ID With Unique Identifier (Leetcode 1378)**

---

### ✅ Problem Summary:

* Two tables:

  * `Employees(id, name)`
  * `EmployeeUNI(id, unique_id)`
* Return all employees with their `name` and corresponding `unique_id` (if available).
* If no `unique_id` exists, show `NULL`.

---

### ✅ Final SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT eu.unique_id, e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu
ON e.id = eu.id;
```

---

### 🧠 Interview Explanation (How to Speak):

> We have two tables. One has employee names and IDs, and the other maps those IDs to universal identifiers.
> I use a **LEFT JOIN** to keep all employees from the `Employees` table.
> If a matching `unique_id` exists in `EmployeeUNI`, it's shown; otherwise, the `unique_id` will be `NULL`.
> I join on the `id` column because it's the common key in both tables.

---

### ⚙️ Query Execution Breakdown:

1. Start with the `Employees` table (`FROM Employees`).
2. For each row, try to match `id` with `EmployeeUNI.id` (`LEFT JOIN ... ON e.id = eu.id`).
3. If match exists → join row.
4. If no match → still keep the employee row, fill `unique_id` with `NULL`.
5. `SELECT` picks `unique_id` (from `EmployeeUNI`) and `name` (from `Employees`).

---

### 💡 Why This Matters in Consulting / Real Projects:

* In real-world data (e.g. HR systems), not every record will have external mapping.
* **LEFT JOIN** avoids **data loss**, keeping full lists even when reference data is missing.
* Shows understanding of **data merging**, **null-safe joins**, and schema relationships.
* Efficient: uses indexed join (`id`), no nested subqueries, minimal computation.

---

### 🧠 Alternative Phrasing for Interview:

> I prioritized a `LEFT JOIN` over `INNER JOIN` because we can’t assume every employee has a universal ID yet.
> This choice prevents accidental omission of employees and aligns with real-world ETL or reporting needs.

---

### 🔍 Extra Tips:

* Use aliases (`e`, `eu`) for cleaner syntax.
* Don't confuse `id` with `unique_id` — always join on matching `id`.

---

Absolutely — let’s walk through the **execution of your query step-by-step**, so you can **understand it deeply and explain it clearly in interviews**.

---

## 🧩 Query:

```sql
SELECT eu.unique_id, e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu
ON e.id = eu.id;
```

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step SQL Execution (MySQL’s Internal Flow)

---

### 🔹 1. `FROM Employees e`

* The database engine starts by scanning the `Employees` table.
* It loads **all rows** from `Employees` into memory as the **base table**.

---

### 🔹 2. `LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id`

* For **each row in `Employees`**, MySQL tries to find a matching row in `EmployeeUNI` **where the `id`s are equal**.

#### Matching logic:

```sql
e.id = eu.id
```

* If a **match is found**, it **combines** the row with columns from both tables.
* If **no match is found**, it keeps the row from `Employees` **and fills columns from `EmployeeUNI` with `NULL`**.

This is **LEFT JOIN** behavior: keep all rows from the left table (Employees).

---

### 🔹 3. `SELECT eu.unique_id, e.name`

* After forming the joined table (with or without matches), MySQL selects **only the columns**:

  * `unique_id` (from `EmployeeUNI`)
  * `name` (from `Employees`)

---

### 🧠 Example Walkthrough:

Given the data:

#### Employees

| id | name     |
| -- | -------- |
| 1  | Alice    |
| 3  | Jonathan |
| 11 | Meir     |

#### EmployeeUNI

| id | unique\_id |
| -- | ---------- |
| 3  | 1          |
| 11 | 2          |

### Join Result:

| e.id | e.name   | eu.id | eu.unique\_id |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 1    | Alice    | NULL  | NULL          |
| 3    | Jonathan | 3     | 1             |
| 11   | Meir     | 11    | 2             |

### Final Output after SELECT:

| unique\_id | name     |
| ---------- | -------- |
| NULL       | Alice    |
| 1          | Jonathan |
| 2          | Meir     |

---

## 🧠 Interview Version: How to Explain Execution

> First, SQL loads all rows from `Employees` as the base.
> Then, it does a `LEFT JOIN` — for each employee, it tries to find a match in `EmployeeUNI` using `id`.
> If it finds a match, it joins them. If not, it keeps the employee and fills in `NULL` for `unique_id`.
> Finally, it returns only the `unique_id` and `name` columns from the joined result.

---


✅ Great job! Your query is **correct** and solves an **extended version** of the original problem — you're not just finding which customers didn’t make a transaction, but also **how many times** each customer visited **without making a transaction**.

---

## ✅ Your Query:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(customer_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

## 🧠 Execution Breakdown:

1. `FROM Visits v` – Start with all visit records.
2. `LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id` – Attach matching transactions (if any).
3. `WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL` – Filter to **visits that had no transaction**.
4. `GROUP BY customer_id` – Group by customer to get per-customer counts.
5. `COUNT(customer_id)` – Count how many such visits each customer had.

---

### 🧠 How to Explain in Interview:

> I want to find **how many visits each customer made without making a transaction**.
>
> First, I start from the `Visits` table and use a `LEFT JOIN` with `Transactions` on `visit_id` so I keep all visit records.
> Then, I filter only those rows where there was **no transaction match** using `t.transaction_id IS NULL`.
> Finally, I group by `customer_id` and count how many such “no-transaction visits” each customer had.

---

### 🚀 Why It’s Valuable to a Consultancy/Real Project:

* This pattern is key in **conversion analytics**: e.g., “How many times did a customer browse but not buy?”
* It helps in **churn analysis**, **targeted marketing**, or **customer segmentation**.
* You’re not just identifying gaps — you’re **quantifying** them, which is critical in business dashboards.
* Efficient: Uses proper `LEFT JOIN`, filters early, and groups late — which is performance-friendly.

---

### 📌 Optional Optimization Tip:

Use `COUNT(*)` instead of `COUNT(customer_id)` because `customer_id` will never be `NULL` here:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
...
```

Same result, and **slightly more efficient**.

Here's the **complete notes** for Leetcode SQL Problem: **197. Rising Temperature**, including:

* Problem overview
* Two approaches (Self Join & Window Function)
* Step-by-step execution flow
* Comparison of optimization
* Explanation of functions used
* Interview perspective

---

### 🔶 Problem Summary:

You're given a `Weather` table:

```sql
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
```

Find the `id` where the **temperature is higher than the previous day’s temperature**.

---

## ✅ Approach 1: Self Join

### 🔸 Query:

```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
  ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

---

### 🔸 Step-by-Step Execution:

1. `Weather` table is aliased as `w1` and `w2`.
2. The `JOIN` condition:

   * `DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1`
     → Matches a row in `w1` to the row in `w2` that occurred exactly **one day before**.
3. `WHERE` clause filters only if:

   * `w1.temperature > w2.temperature`
4. Result: Return the `id` of `w1` rows satisfying this condition.

---

### 🔸 Example:

| id | recordDate | temperature |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 2025-07-01 | 30          |
| 2  | 2025-07-02 | 32          |
| 3  | 2025-07-03 | 31          |
| 4  | 2025-07-05 | 35          |

🔸 Join:

* 2025-07-02 joins with 2025-07-01 → 32 > 30 ✅
* 2025-07-03 joins with 2025-07-02 → 31 < 32 ❌
* 2025-07-05 can't join (no 2025-07-04) ❌

🔸 Output:

```text
id
--
2
```

---

## ✅ Approach 2: Window Function

### 🔸 Query:

```sql
SELECT id
FROM (
  SELECT id, recordDate, temperature,
         LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
  FROM Weather
) AS sub
WHERE temperature > prev_temp;
```

---

### 🔸 Step-by-Step Execution:

1. Use `LAG(temperature)` to get the previous row's temperature.
2. `OVER (ORDER BY recordDate)` ensures chronological order.
3. The subquery now has:

   * `id`, `recordDate`, `temperature`, and `prev_temp`
4. Outer query filters only if:

   * `temperature > prev_temp`

---

### 🔸 Window Function Output:

| id | recordDate | temperature | prev\_temp |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1  | 2025-07-01 | 30          | NULL       |
| 2  | 2025-07-02 | 32          | 30         |
| 3  | 2025-07-03 | 31          | 32         |
| 4  | 2025-07-05 | 35          | 31         |

🔸 Filter:

* Row 2: 32 > 30 ✅
* Row 3: 31 < 32 ❌
* Row 4: 35 > 31 ✅

🔸 Output:

```text
id
--
2
4
```

📝 *This may differ slightly from self-join if dates are not consecutive.*

| Criteria      | Self Join                       | Window Function                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Handles gaps? | ❌ Requires consecutive dates    | ✅ Handles gaps in dates           |
| Performance   | Medium – JOIN + DATEDIFF        | High – Single scan with window fn |
| Simplicity    | Medium – Requires join logic    | Cleaner and readable              |
| Interview use | Good for testing join knowledge | Good for testing advanced SQL     |

---

## 🔍 Interview Discussion:

* **Start with Self Join**, as it’s a classic method to simulate "previous day".
* Then **explain window function** as an optimized approach.
* Emphasize:

  * *Why window functions scale better for large datasets.*
  * *Why handling missing dates gracefully matters in real-world analytics.*

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts:

| Concept           | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DATEDIFF(a,b)`   | Returns number of days between two dates (a - b)             |
| `LAG(column)`     | Returns previous row's value in a result set                 |
| `OVER()`          | Defines the window or range of rows for window functions     |
| `Self Join`       | Joining a table with itself to compare different rows        |
| `Window Function` | Allows operations across sets of rows related to current one |

---

## 🏢 Why It Matters to Consultancy Companies:

* Real-world data (weather, stock, customer logs) often needs temporal analysis.
* Business problems often deal with trends — this question tests that.
* They assess:

  * How you handle NULLs, gaps in data
  * Your SQL optimization knowledge
  * Clean, readable queries for analytics teams

---

Absolutely! Let's take each **window function** example and walk through it with:

* ✅ **Sample Input Table**
* 🔄 **Window Function Query**
* 📤 **Expected Output**

---

## ✅ 1. `ROW_NUMBER()` — Assign unique row number per partition

### 👇 Sample Input: `employees`

| id | name  | department | salary |
| -- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1  | Alice | HR         | 50000  |
| 2  | Bob   | HR         | 45000  |
| 3  | Carol | IT         | 70000  |
| 4  | Dave  | IT         | 80000  |
| 5  | Eve   | IT         | 65000  |

---

### 🔄 Query

```sql
SELECT name, department, salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

---

### 📤 Output

| name  | department | salary | rank |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ | ---- |
| Alice | HR         | 50000  | 1    |
| Bob   | HR         | 45000  | 2    |
| Dave  | IT         | 80000  | 1    |
| Carol | IT         | 70000  | 2    |
| Eve   | IT         | 65000  | 3    |

🧠 Rows are grouped **by department**, ordered by **salary DESC**, and numbered starting from 1 in each group.

---

## ✅ 2. `LAG()` — Previous row value (great for difference or trend analysis)

### 👇 Sample Input: `weather`

| id | recordDate | temperature |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 2023-01-01 | 20          |
| 2  | 2023-01-02 | 22          |
| 3  | 2023-01-03 | 21          |
| 4  | 2023-01-04 | 25          |

---

### 🔄 Query

```sql
SELECT id, recordDate, temperature,
  LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
FROM weather;
```

---

### 📤 Output

| id | recordDate | temperature | prev\_temp |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1  | 2023-01-01 | 20          | NULL       |
| 2  | 2023-01-02 | 22          | 20         |
| 3  | 2023-01-03 | 21          | 22         |
| 4  | 2023-01-04 | 25          | 21         |

🧠 First row has `NULL` because there's no previous row. Each next row shows the **temperature from the previous date**.

---

## ✅ 3. `SUM()` — Running total with `OVER(ORDER BY...)`

### 👇 Sample Input: `sales`

| id | salesman | sales |
| -- | -------- | ----- |
| 1  | Raj      | 100   |
| 2  | Ravi     | 200   |
| 3  | Riya     | 150   |
| 4  | Reena    | 250   |

---

### 🔄 Query

```sql
SELECT salesman, sales,
  SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS running_total
FROM sales;
```

---

### 📤 Output

| salesman | sales | running\_total |
| -------- | ----- | -------------- |
| Raj      | 100   | 100            |
| Ravi     | 200   | 300            |
| Riya     | 150   | 450            |
| Reena    | 250   | 700            |

🧠 The running total increases row by row — it sums up all sales **up to the current row**.

---

## ✅ 4. `RANK()` — Ranking with same value tie

### 👇 Sample Input: `students`

| id | name   | score |
| -- | ------ | ----- |
| 1  | Aman   | 90    |
| 2  | Bharat | 95    |
| 3  | Chetan | 95    |
| 4  | Dinesh | 80    |

---

### 🔄 Query

```sql
SELECT name, score,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM students;
```

---

### 📤 Output

| name   | score | rank |
| ------ | ----- | ---- |
| Bharat | 95    | 1    |
| Chetan | 95    | 1    |
| Aman   | 90    | 3    |
| Dinesh | 80    | 4    |

🧠 **`RANK()`** gives **same rank to tied values**, but **skips next rank**. (Notice: after 1, the next rank is 3).

---

## ✅ 5. `LEAD()` — Next row value

### 👇 Sample Input: `weather`

| id | date       | temperature |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 2023-01-01 | 20          |
| 2  | 2023-01-02 | 22          |
| 3  | 2023-01-03 | 21          |

---

### 🔄 Query

```sql
SELECT date, temperature,
  LEAD(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS next_temp
FROM weather;
```

---

### 📤 Output

| date       | temperature | next\_temp |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 2023-01-01 | 20          | 22         |
| 2023-01-02 | 22          | 21         |
| 2023-01-03 | 21          | NULL       |

🧠 Similar to `LAG()`, but it looks **ahead**.

---

### 💡 Recap Table

| Function       | Purpose                     | Looks at       |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| `ROW_NUMBER()` | Unique row number per group | Current row    |
| `LAG()`        | Get previous row’s value    | Previous row   |
| `LEAD()`       | Get next row’s value        | Next row       |
| `RANK()`       | Rank with gaps for ties     | All rows       |
| `SUM()`        | Running total or window sum | All prior rows |

 **guide on SQL Query Optimization Techniques** with **sample input/output examples** and the **reason why unoptimized versions are slower**. 

---

## ✅ **1. Avoid SELECT \* (Column Pruning)**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM Employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* `SELECT *` fetches all columns, which increases I/O and memory usage.
* Only required columns should be selected to reduce data load.

### 📥 Input:

| id | name | department | salary | email                     |
| -- | ---- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| 1  | A    | Sales      | 3000   | [a@x.com](mailto:a@x.com) |
| 2  | B    | IT         | 4000   | [b@x.com](mailto:b@x.com) |

### 📤 Output:

```text
id | name
---------
1  | A
```

---

## ✅ **2. Use EXISTS instead of IN for correlated subqueries**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customers
WHERE id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Orders);
```

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id);
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* `IN` can cause performance issues with large subquery results.
* `EXISTS` stops at the first match, thus faster for correlated data.

---

## ✅ **3. Use JOINs instead of Subqueries**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customers
WHERE id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Orders WHERE total > 100);
```

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.name
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.total > 100;
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* JOINs are generally faster than IN or subqueries due to better optimizer paths and indexing.

---

## ✅ **4. Index Usage**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = 101;
```

(no index on `customer_id`)

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
-- Add index first
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON Orders(customer_id);

-- Then query
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = 101;
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* Indexes drastically speed up search and filtering.
* Without an index, the DB performs full table scan.

---

## ✅ **5. Use LIMIT for Pagination or Sampling**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders;
```

(returns 100,000 rows when only 10 needed)

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 10;
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* LIMIT reduces memory, I/O, and network transfer cost.

---

## ✅ **6. Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE YEAR(join_date) = 2022;
```

(index on `join_date` won't be used)

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE join_date >= '2022-01-01' AND join_date < '2023-01-01';
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* Applying functions disables index use.
* Use date range filtering instead.

---

## ✅ **7. Use Window Functions Instead of Self-JOIN**

### 🔻Unoptimized (Self Join):

```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
  AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

### ✅ Optimized (Window Function):

```sql
SELECT id
FROM (
  SELECT id, recordDate, temperature,
         LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
  FROM Weather
) t
WHERE temperature > prev_temp;
```

### 📥 Input:

| id | recordDate | temperature |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 2022-01-01 | 20          |
| 2  | 2022-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2022-01-03 | 18          |

### 📤 Output:

```text
id
---
2
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* Self-joins create Cartesian products, then filter them → expensive.
* `LAG()` avoids joining the table with itself, using an internal buffer → faster.

---

## ✅ **8. Use UNION ALL Instead of UNION**

### 🔻Unoptimized:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM Contractors;
```

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM Contractors;
```

### 🎯 Reason:

* `UNION` removes duplicates → extra sort operation.
* Use `UNION ALL` if you don’t need deduplication.

---

## ✅ **Summary Table of Techniques**

| Technique                    | Why It’s Better                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Avoid SELECT \*              | Less memory and I/O                             |
| Use EXISTS over IN           | Stops early, better for correlated queries      |
| Prefer JOINs over subqueries | JOINs benefit from indexing and optimizer paths |
| Create indexes               | Fast lookup/search                              |
| Use LIMIT                    | Limits rows returned, speeds pagination         |
| Avoid functions on columns   | Keeps indexes usable                            |
| Use Window Functions         | Avoids complex joins for ranking, comparison    |
| Use UNION ALL                | No unnecessary sorting or deduplication         |

Here are **theoretical query optimization techniques** you should explain to the interviewer **if you're asked how you would optimize any SQL query**:

---

## ✅ **General SQL Query Optimization Techniques**

These techniques are used by developers, analysts, DBAs, and consultants to improve query performance:

---

### 1. **Avoid SELECT \***

* ❌ Bad: `SELECT * FROM Customers`
* ✅ Good: `SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM Customers`
* 🔍 **Why?** SELECT \* fetches unnecessary columns, increasing I/O and memory usage.

---

### 2. **Use WHERE Clauses to Filter Early**

* ❌ Without filter: `SELECT * FROM Orders`
* ✅ With filter: `SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE status = 'shipped'`
* 🔍 **Why?** Reduces number of rows processed, lowering computation time.

---

### 3. **Use Proper Indexes**

* Create indexes on **columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY**.
* ✅ `CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON Orders(customer_id);`
* 🔍 **Why?** Indexing allows faster data lookup (similar to searching in a sorted book index).

---

### 4. **Use JOINs Efficiently**

* ✅ Use INNER JOIN over OUTER JOIN when possible
* ✅ Filter as early as possible
* 🔍 **Why?** Unnecessary joins or large Cartesian products increase row scan size.

---

### 5. **Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns**

* ❌ `WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023`
* ✅ `WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01' AND order_date < '2024-01-01'`
* 🔍 **Why?** Functions disable indexes, causing full table scan.

---

### 6. **Use EXISTS Instead of IN (For Large Subqueries)**

* ❌ `WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Returns)`
* ✅ `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Returns r WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id)`
* 🔍 **Why?** EXISTS stops at first match; IN evaluates the whole list.

---

### 7. **Limit Result Set Early**

* ✅ Use `LIMIT` or `TOP` when only sample data is needed.
* 🔍 **Why?** Prevents loading unnecessary rows into memory.

---

### 8. **Use WINDOW Functions Over Subqueries**

* ✅ Use `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()` instead of complex subqueries.
* 🔍 **Why?** Window functions process over a smaller partition efficiently.

---

### 9. **Avoid Nested Subqueries If JOINs Can Do It**

* ❌ Subquery inside SELECT/WHERE
* ✅ Use JOINs and CTEs
* 🔍 **Why?** JOINs can be optimized better by query planners.

---

### 10. **Analyze Execution Plan (EXPLAIN)**

* ✅ `EXPLAIN SELECT ...`
* 🔍 **Why?** Tells which indexes are used, where full scans happen.

---

## ✨ Sample Input / Output Example

**Query:** Get names of customers who made no orders

### ❌ Inefficient:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customers
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Orders);
```

* 🔴 Full table scan of Orders
* 🔴 Subquery loads entire result in memory

### ✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT c.name FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
```

* 🟢 Faster with index on `customer_id`
* 🟢 Stops at first non-match (no need to load all)

---

## 🚀 What to Say to Interviewer:

> "I would begin by checking if the query uses unnecessary columns (SELECT \*), then review the use of indexes and joins. I'd also check for subqueries that can be replaced by JOINs or window functions. I use EXPLAIN to analyze the execution plan and identify full table scans or inefficient operations."

---
Here’s **how to explain SQL query optimization to an interviewer** in a **theoretical and structured way**, with **common techniques** and **when to use them**:

---

### ✅ **What Is Query Optimization?**

**Query optimization** is the process of improving the performance of a query so that it runs faster and uses fewer resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This is important for handling large datasets efficiently.

---

### ✅ **How Would You Explain Query Optimization in an Interview?**

You can structure your answer like this:

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation:

### 1. **Start with Why**

> "Optimizing a query means reducing execution time and resource usage while maintaining correct results. This is critical in production systems where performance directly affects scalability and user experience."

---

### 2. **General Optimization Techniques**

You can break this into **4 major groups** with examples:

---

#### 🔹 A. **Indexing**

> “Use indexes on columns that are frequently searched, sorted, or joined.”

* ❌ Without Index:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department = 'IT';
  ```

  * Scans the entire table.

* ✅ With Index:

  ```sql
  -- Index on department column
  CREATE INDEX idx_dept ON Employees(department);
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department = 'IT';
  ```

**Reason:** Index makes WHERE clause faster by avoiding full table scan.

---

#### 🔹 B. \*\*Avoid SELECT \*\*\*

> "Always select only required columns instead of using `SELECT *`."

* ❌

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE status = 'Pending';
  ```
* ✅

  ```sql
  SELECT order_id, status FROM Orders WHERE status = 'Pending';
  ```

**Reason:** Reduces data transferred, memory usage, and improves clarity.

---

#### 🔹 C. **Use WHERE before GROUP BY / ORDER BY**

> "Reduce data as early as possible."

* ❌

  ```sql
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id;
  ```
* ✅

  ```sql
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) FROM Orders 
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY customer_id;
  ```

**Reason:** Filtering before grouping reduces the number of rows to group.

---

#### 🔹 D. **Use Joins Efficiently**

> "Avoid unnecessary joins. Use INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN when NULLs are not needed."

* ❌

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Orders LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.id;
  ```
* ✅

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.id;
  ```

**Reason:** LEFT JOIN retains extra NULL data when not required.

---

#### 🔹 E. **Use EXISTS Instead of IN (if subquery returns many rows)**

> "EXISTS stops as soon as condition is true, but IN evaluates all rows."

* ❌

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Products 
  WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM OrderDetails);
  ```
* ✅

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Products 
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM OrderDetails WHERE OrderDetails.product_id = Products.product_id);
  ```

**Reason:** `EXISTS` is faster for large subquery results.

---

#### 🔹 F. **Use Window Functions Instead of Self-Join or Subqueries**

> "Window functions are more efficient for row-by-row comparisons."

* ❌ (Self-Join)

  ```sql
  SELECT w1.id FROM Weather w1
  JOIN Weather w2 
    ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
   AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
  ```

* ✅ (Window Function)

  ```sql
  SELECT id 
  FROM (
    SELECT id, temperature, recordDate,
           LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp
    FROM Weather
  ) AS sub
  WHERE temperature > prev_temp;
  ```

**Reason:** Window function avoids scanning the same table twice.

---

### 3. **Other Smart Tips**

* Normalize/denormalize depending on reads vs writes.
* Use query execution plans to see which part is slow.
* Use LIMIT when only a few results are needed.
* Materialize expensive subqueries or views if reused.

---

### ✅ Sample Line to Say in Interview:

> "If I encounter a slow query, I first look at execution plans, check indexing, remove unnecessary columns or joins, and replace subqueries with window functions where possible. My goal is to filter early and compute late."

---



Great question!

Let’s **compare `WHERE` vs `HAVING`** and explain **why `WHERE` is the right choice** in your query.

---

### ✅ Your Query:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM Orders 
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

### 🔍 Why not `HAVING`?

Because `HAVING` is **used to filter after aggregation** (i.e., after `GROUP BY`), whereas `WHERE` is used to **filter rows before aggregation**.

---

### ⚖️ Difference Between WHERE and HAVING:

| Clause   | When it is applied              | Used for          | Can it use aggregate functions?   |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `WHERE`  | **Before** grouping/aggregation | Filter **rows**   | ❌ No aggregates (like COUNT, SUM) |
| `HAVING` | **After** grouping/aggregation  | Filter **groups** | ✅ Yes, used with aggregates       |

---

### 👇 Your case:

You're filtering on:

```sql
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
```

* ✅ This is a condition on **individual rows**.
* You want to consider only those rows where `order_date` is on or after Jan 1, 2024.
* So you use `WHERE`, because you filter *before* the aggregation (`GROUP BY`).

---

### 🧪 Example:

#### Input Table: `Orders`

| order\_id | customer\_id | order\_date |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1         | 101          | 2023-12-30  |
| 2         | 101          | 2024-01-02  |
| 3         | 102          | 2024-01-05  |
| 4         | 101          | 2024-02-01  |

---

### ✅ Correct Query with WHERE:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM Orders 
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Output:

| customer\_id | COUNT(\*) |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 101          | 2         |
| 102          | 1         |

* Only orders after Jan 1, 2024 are counted.

---

### ❌ What happens if you use `HAVING` instead?

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM Orders 
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING order_date >= '2024-01-01';  -- ❌ ERROR!
```

* 🔴 This gives an error because `order_date` is not part of `GROUP BY` or an aggregate function.
* `HAVING` can't access individual row columns like `order_date` unless they're aggregated or grouped.

---

### ✅ When to use `HAVING`:

If you wanted to filter **groups**, like customers who placed **more than 3 orders**, then use `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

---

### 💡 Summary:

| Use this | When                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `WHERE`  | To filter rows **before** aggregation  |
| `HAVING` | To filter groups **after** aggregation |






Here are **concise, structured notes** for the SQL interview question:

---

## ✅ **Question Summary**

**Goal:**
Find the average processing time for each machine.

**Table:** `Activity`

| Column         | Type  | Description                 |
| -------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| machine\_id    | int   | ID of the machine           |
| process\_id    | int   | ID of the process           |
| activity\_type | enum  | Either `'start'` or `'end'` |
| timestamp      | float | Time in seconds             |

**Rule:**
For every `(machine_id, process_id)` pair:

* One `'start'` and one `'end'` row exist.
* `end.timestamp > start.timestamp`.

---

## 📌 **Approach (Using JOIN)**

```sql
SELECT 
  a1.machine_id, 
  ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM 
  Activity a1
JOIN 
  Activity a2 
  ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id 
     AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
WHERE 
  a1.activity_type = 'start' 
  AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY 
  a1.machine_id;
```

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Self-Join Table

We join `Activity` table with itself:

```sql
ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
```

⏩ This pairs up each `start` row with its matching `end` row based on `machine_id` and `process_id`.

---

### Step 2: Filter Only `start` and `end`

```sql
WHERE a1.activity_type = 'start' AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
```

⏩ Keeps only valid start–end pairs.

---

### Step 3: Calculate Time Difference

```sql
a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp
```

⏩ Time taken for that process.

---

### Step 4: Group By `machine_id`

```sql
GROUP BY a1.machine_id
```

⏩ Calculates one average per machine.

---

### Step 5: Average and Round

```sql
ROUND(AVG(...), 3)
```

⏩ Final result with `processing_time` rounded to 3 decimal places.

## ✅ Sample Input

| machine\_id | process\_id | activity\_type | timestamp |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- |
| 1           | 1           | start          | 0.0       |
| 1           | 1           | end            | 4.0       |
| 1           | 2           | start          | 2.0       |
| 1           | 2           | end            | 5.0       |
| 2           | 1           | start          | 1.0       |
| 2           | 1           | end            | 7.0       |

---

## ✅ Output

| machine\_id | processing\_time |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | 3.5              |
| 2           | 6.0              |

## 📌 Notes Comparison: WHERE vs JOIN

| Aspect         | `WHERE` Style                         | `JOIN` Style                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Syntax         | Simpler for small queries             | More readable and scalable         |
| Join Condition | Defined in `WHERE`                    | Defined clearly with `JOIN ON`     |
| Readability    | Can get messy in complex queries      | Better separation of logic         |
| Performance    | Same under-the-hood (MySQL optimizes) | No major difference for INNER JOIN |

Let's go through this SQL query step-by-step with **detailed explanation**, **input-output simulation**, and **execution logic**. This query answers the question:

> **“How many exams each student attended per subject?”**
> Even if a student didn’t attend a subject’s exam, the result must include that with **0**.

---

### 🔢 **Table Structures**

#### `Students`

| student\_id | student\_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | Alice         |
| 2           | Bob           |

#### `Subjects`

| subject\_name |
| ------------- |
| Math          |
| Physics       |

#### `Examinations`

| student\_id | subject\_name | score |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1           | Math          | 80    |
| 1           | Physics       | 70    |
| 2           | Math          | 90    |

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Execution

### 🔹 **Step 1: CROSS JOIN**

```sql
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects su
```

This creates **all possible combinations** of each student with each subject.

📌 **Intermediate Result (CROSS JOIN)**

| student\_id | student\_name | subject\_name |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1           | Alice         | Math          |
| 1           | Alice         | Physics       |
| 2           | Bob           | Math          |
| 2           | Bob           | Physics       |

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: LEFT JOIN Examinations**

```sql
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id
AND su.subject_name = e.subject_name
```

Now we're trying to **match each student-subject pair** with actual exam records (if any). Since it's a **LEFT JOIN**, if a student didn't attend that subject, `NULL` is returned for that exam row.

📌 **Result after LEFT JOIN:**

| student\_id | student\_name | subject\_name | e.student\_id | e.subject\_name | score |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| 1           | Alice         | Math          | 1             | Math            | 80    |
| 1           | Alice         | Physics       | 1             | Physics         | 70    |
| 2           | Bob           | Math          | 2             | Math            | 90    |
| 2           | Bob           | Physics       | NULL          | NULL            | NULL  |

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: GROUP BY + COUNT()**

```sql
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, su.subject_name
```

For each student-subject pair, we count the number of exams they appeared for:

```sql
count(e.student_id) as attended_exams
```

* For attended exams, `e.student_id` is **not NULL**, so it counts.
* For missed exams, `e.student_id` is **NULL**, so not counted.

📌 **Final Output Table:**

| student\_id | student\_name | subject\_name | attended\_exams |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Alice         | Math          | 1               |
| 1           | Alice         | Physics       | 1               |
| 2           | Bob           | Math          | 1               |
| 2           | Bob           | Physics       | 0               |

---

### 🔚 **Step 4: ORDER BY**

```sql
ORDER BY s.student_id, su.subject_name
```

Sort the result neatly by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

Let's walk through this query **step by step**, including input and intermediate outputs to explain what's happening:

---

### 🔸**Input Table: `Employee`**

| id | name   | managerId |
| -- | ------ | --------- |
| 1  | John   | null      |
| 2  | Robert | 1         |
| 3  | Tom    | 1         |
| 4  | Jerry  | 1         |
| 5  | Donald | 1         |
| 6  | Alice  | 1         |
| 7  | Steve  | 2         |
| 8  | Bob    | 2         |

---

### 🔸**Query Explanation**

```sql
SELECT a1.name
FROM Employee a1
JOIN Employee a2
ON a1.id = a2.managerId
GROUP BY a2.managerId
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
```

---

### 🔹**Step 1: Self-Join**

We are joining the table to itself.

* `a1` represents **manager**
* `a2` represents **employee**

```sql
JOIN Employee a2
ON a1.id = a2.managerId
```

🔸 This join will match every employee (`a2`) with their manager (`a1`), producing a table like:

| a1.id (Manager ID) | a1.name | a2.id (Employee ID) | a2.managerId |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1                  | John    | 2                   | 1            |
| 1                  | John    | 3                   | 1            |
| 1                  | John    | 4                   | 1            |
| 1                  | John    | 5                   | 1            |
| 1                  | John    | 6                   | 1            |
| 2                  | Robert  | 7                   | 2            |
| 2                  | Robert  | 8                   | 2            |

---

### 🔹**Step 2: `GROUP BY a2.managerId`**

We group this joined data by manager ID.

So the grouping would be:

* Group 1: Manager ID = 1 (John) → employees: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Count = 5)
* Group 2: Manager ID = 2 (Robert) → employees: 7, 8 (Count = 2)

---

### 🔹**Step 3: `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5`**

This filters only those groups where a manager has **5 or more employees**.

Only John satisfies this condition.

---

### 🔹**Step 4: `SELECT a1.name`**

We output the manager’s name (from alias `a1`):

| name |
| ---- |
| John |

---

### ✅ Final Output

| name |
| ---- |
| John |

---

### 📝 Summary Notes

* **Self-join** is used to relate employees with their managers.
* We **count how many employees report to each manager**.
* `GROUP BY a2.managerId` groups by manager.
* `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` filters to managers with 5+ direct reports.
* The query returns **names of those managers**.

Here are **detailed step-by-step notes** for this SQL query, including its **purpose**, **tables**, **execution explanation**, and **output**:

---

## ✅ **Problem Purpose**

Find the **average selling price** of each product **based on a date range** defined in the `Prices` table and sales records from `UnitsSold`.

---

## 📋 **Tables**

### 1. `Prices`

| product\_id | start\_date | end\_date  | price |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1           | 2024-01-01  | 2024-01-31 | 10.00 |
| 1           | 2024-02-01  | 2024-02-28 | 12.00 |
| 2           | 2024-01-01  | 2024-02-28 | 8.00  |

* Defines **price ranges** for each product over **specific date intervals**.

---

### 2. `UnitsSold`

| product\_id | purchase\_date | units |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1           | 2024-01-10     | 100   |
| 1           | 2024-02-10     | 200   |
| 2           | 2024-01-20     | 50    |

* Stores **how many units** of each product were sold **on specific dates**.

---

## 🔍 **Query Breakdown & Execution Steps**

```sql
SELECT 
  p.product_id, 
  ROUND(IFNULL((SUM(p.price * s.units) / SUM(s.units)), 0), 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold s
  ON p.product_id = s.product_id
  AND s.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

---

### 🔢 **Step-by-Step Execution**

#### ✅ Step 1: `LEFT JOIN`

```sql
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold s
  ON p.product_id = s.product_id
  AND s.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
```

* Joins the `Prices` and `UnitsSold` tables.
* **Only includes UnitsSold rows** where `purchase_date` is **within the price period** defined by `start_date` and `end_date`.

🧠 **Important**:

* `LEFT JOIN` ensures **every price range is preserved** even if no units were sold during that time.

---

#### ✅ Step 2: `p.price * s.units`

* Multiplies the **price during the matched period** by **units sold** to compute **revenue** for that period.

---

#### ✅ Step 3: `SUM(p.price * s.units)` and `SUM(s.units)`

```sql
ROUND(IFNULL((SUM(p.price * s.units) / SUM(s.units)), 0), 2)
```

* Total revenue / total units = **average price actually paid**.
* `IFNULL(..., 0)` ensures:

  * If **no sales**, the result is `0` (prevents division by NULL).
* `ROUND(..., 2)` formats the answer to **2 decimal places**.

---

#### ✅ Step 4: `GROUP BY p.product_id`

* Aggregates results **per product** (even across multiple time ranges and sales).

---

### 📤 Final Output Format

| product\_id | average\_price |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 1           | 11.33          |
| 2           | 8.00           |

*(Example: Product 1 had 100 units @ ₹10 and 200 units @ ₹12 → Avg = (100×10 + 200×12)/300 = ₹11.33)*

Here are detailed **notes and step-by-step explanation** for the given MySQL query:

---

### ✅ **Question Objective**

You are given two tables: `Project` and `Employee`. Each project is assigned to an employee, and each employee has a certain number of experience years.

**Goal**: For each `project_id`, calculate the **average experience** (in years) of employees working on that project.

---

### 📑 **Tables**

#### 1. `Project` Table

| project\_id | employee\_id |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | 101          |
| 1           | 102          |
| 2           | 103          |
| 2           | 104          |
| 3           | 105          |

#### 2. `Employee` Table

| employee\_id | experience\_years |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| 101          | 3                 |
| 102          | 5                 |
| 103          | 7                 |
| 104          | 6                 |
| 105          | 4                 |

---

### ✅ **Query**

```sql
SELECT 
  p.project_id,
  ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
  Project p
JOIN 
  Employee e
ON 
  p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
  p.project_id;
```

---

### ⚙️ **Step-by-Step Execution**

#### 🔹 Step 1: `JOIN` `Project` with `Employee`

We match each project’s `employee_id` to the `employee_id` in the `Employee` table to get their experience.

**Result after JOIN**:

| project\_id | employee\_id | experience\_years |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1           | 101          | 3                 |
| 1           | 102          | 5                 |
| 2           | 103          | 7                 |
| 2           | 104          | 6                 |
| 3           | 105          | 4                 |

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: `GROUP BY p.project_id`

We group the rows by `project_id`, so we can calculate aggregate functions like `AVG()` for each group.

**Groups formed**:

* Group 1: project\_id = 1 → \[3, 5]
* Group 2: project\_id = 2 → \[7, 6]
* Group 3: project\_id = 3 → \[4]

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: `AVG()` and `ROUND(...)`

We calculate the average experience for each project and round to 2 decimal places:

* Project 1: (3 + 5) / 2 = **4.00**
* Project 2: (7 + 6) / 2 = **6.50**
* Project 3: (4) = **4.00**

---

### 📤 Final Output

| project\_id | average\_years |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 1           | 4.00           |
| 2           | 6.50           |
| 3           | 4.00           |

---

### 🧠 Notes Summary

* **JOIN** is used to get each employee's experience for their assigned project.
* **GROUP BY** groups all rows by `project_id` for aggregation.
* **AVG()** computes average experience per project.
* **ROUND(x, 2)** ensures the result is rounded to 2 decimal places.
* **If there are no employees on a project**, that project won’t appear in result (because we used `JOIN`, not `LEFT JOIN`).

Here is a **step-by-step explanation** of the query:

---

### ✅ **SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
  LEFT(trans_date, 7) AS month,
  country,
  COUNT(*) AS trans_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
  SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
  SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country;
```

---

### 🧠 **Objective:**

To generate a **monthly and country-wise transaction report** with:

* Total transactions
* Number of approved transactions
* Total transaction amount
* Total approved transaction amount

---

### 📘 **Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **`LEFT(trans_date, 7) AS month`**

   * Extracts only the year and month from the `trans_date` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) → returns `YYYY-MM`
   * For example:
     `2025-07-14` → `2025-07`
     `2025-07-28` → `2025-07`

2. **`COUNT(*) AS trans_count`**

   * Counts the **total number of transactions** for that `(month, country)` group.

3. **`SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`**

   * Counts **how many of those transactions were approved**.

4. **`SUM(amount)`**

   * Adds up the total `amount` of **all transactions** in that group.

5. **`SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)`**

   * Adds up the **amounts of only the approved transactions**.

6. **`FROM Transactions`**

   * Uses the `Transactions` table as the data source.

7. **`GROUP BY month, country`**

   * Groups the data **by extracted month and country**, so every group will have:

     * One month
     * One country
     * And all the corresponding transactions for that pair

---

### 📊 **Sample Input Table: `Transactions`**

| trans\_id | country | state    | amount | trans\_date |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |

| 2         | India   | declined | 50     | 2025-07-03  |
| 3         | US      | approved | 120    | 2025-07-10  |
| 4         | India   | approved | 80     | 2025-07-15  |
| 5         | India   | approved | 90     | 2025-08-01  |

---

### 📤 **Grouped Output:**
